# Contributing
You're welcome to contribute any code and even expand Tools into new areas. There are a few preferences I have, however:
1) Code should function statically, as Tools is intended for use without instantiation
2) Replacements of existing code is fine given the functionality is the same and run time is reduced
3) Please group files into relevant namespaces/classes, or new ones if none are suitable
4) Provide XML documentation if you can (at least a description and args for methods)
