# Contributing
You're welcome to contribute code and to expand Tools into new areas of your liking. However, new additions should be conscious that:
1) Code functions statically, as Tools is intended for use without instantiation
2) Replacements of existing code requires that there be no change in functionality unless run time is reduced
3) Files are grouped into relevant namespaces/classes, or new ones if none are currently suitable
4) Code should have at least minimal XML documentation (eg. a description and args)
